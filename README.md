# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview

The objective of this project is to:

- Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
- Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
- Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
- Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
- Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
- Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
- Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
- Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
- Render maps on a local server.

## Instructions

- Create a config.js in each subfolder containing 'const API_KEY = "\<your mapbox api key\>"'
- Start a web server at root folder and navigate to each subfolder to see results. I suggest 'python -m http.server'
